# cantcha

A mini-project developed at [Code The City 13](https://github.com/CodeTheCity/CTC13) - Hacking Our Relationship With Alcohol.

## Aim

The aim of this project is to demonstrate how difficult it is to tell an alcolholic drink label from a non-aloholic one. 

To do this we have created a captch (aka a cantcha) to show this.
