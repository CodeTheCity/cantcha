# cantcha

A mini-project developed at [https://github.com/CodeTheCity/CTC13](Code The City 13 - Hacking Our Relationship With Alcohol).

## Aim

The aim of this project is to demonstrate how difficult it is to tell an alcolholic drink label from a non-aloholic one. 

To do this we have created a captch (aka a cantcha) to show this.
